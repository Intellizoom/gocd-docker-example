# GoCD Docker Example

This repository demonstrates how to start both a GoCD Server and Agent.  It adapts the GoCD Docker builds from their repo (at the time they didn't have the images pushed to Docker hub).

To run the GoCD infrastructure, simply use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
